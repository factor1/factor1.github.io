<H1>We aspire to do great work like every other agency. We just think the ability to achieve great work is a direct result of aligning clients and employees who work well together. With this goal in mind, we’ve developed a set of principles we expect our employees to adopt. </H1>

</div>
</div>

<div class="row">

<h2>Value our position and points of differentiation</h2>
<p>We are helpers. Our team is built around helping others succeed. Whether that is a church trying to grow its weekly attendance, or a small business trying to increase its position and sales. In short, we’re marketers first, creatives and developers second. You must embrace this principle to be happy here.</p>

</div>
<div class="row">

<h2>Believe in our approach</h2>
<p>Our job is simple: continually provide our clients with options that we believe in so we can be proud of any choice they make. We believe this approach is what drives our growth - but it comes with a learning curve and requires bit of humility.</p>

</div>
<div class="row">

<h2>Think positive</h2>
<p>Nothing brings a team down like negativity. No place is perfect. We’re flawed just like every other organization of human beings. But we’re self-aware, determined to improve, and have a history of progress unique to other companies. While we realize everyone wants to moan and complain on occasion, we expect you to be open, honest, optimistic and constructive.</p>

</div>
<div class="row">

<h2>Learn to fail efficiently</h2>
<p>We expect you to be smart, dedicated, and good. We expect you to succeed and excel. We also expect you to make mistakes along the way. We just ask that you become really good at making them. Take small risks, correct mistakes quickly, then repeat. Don’t make the same mistakes over and over. And always be accountable.</p>

</div>
<div class="row">

<h2>Always consider what you don’t know</h2>
<p>Accept that you don’t know for sure what the client will like. That you don’t fully understand your role in marketing. That you have no idea how many distractions your dismissive client has been dealing with during your conference call. That you can’t possibly know everyone’s motive or intention. And that the only way to learn is by asking questions, not asserting your position.</p>

</div>
<div class="row">

<h2>Dive in and begin</h2>
<p>Leave your insecurities, formalities, and hesitations behind. We don’t have the time, energy, or resources to work around them. We want and expect you to contribute immediately. Share your opinions. Ask for the things you need. You’re encouraged to make decisions and allowed to make mistakes. Be brave. Be passionate. Use good judgment. </p>

</div>
<div class="row">

<h2>When in doubt, do something</h2>
<p>If you can’t decide between action and inaction, choose action. You’ll make progress faster, gather relevant information sooner, and gain experience that helps you improve your plan for the future.</p>
